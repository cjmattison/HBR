    inscription: "In 2019, when Hou Beiren was 103, he made this work of calligraphy to commemorate his time in Hong Kong. In autumn 1949, my wife Zhang Yunqing and I left Beijing and settled in Diamond Hill, Kowloon, where I made a living as a writer. In 1950, my son Hou Yilong was born and then my daughter Hou Dagang in 1952. Making a living as a writer was quite challenging, but the effort I put in was fruitful. I wrote numerous articles, individual prose works and books. During this period, I first met many famous artists such as Zhang Daqian and Zheng Shiqiao, from whom I learned much during our discussions on painting. Many of the articles I published at that time are still valued among the literary community. It has now been half a century since moving to California in autumn 1956. Time waits for no one. I have spent my whole life painting, and now realize that I indeed have grown old. I can still hold a brush, though my hair has turned white. I made this work of calligraphy to express my feelings for all of the renowned individuals and friends who I came to know, and for the University of Hong Kong. Hou Beiren at Old Apricot Villa, 8 August 2019"
