For the inscription to this work Hou Beiren recalls two poems from the Tang and Song dynasty which he has paired with a peony.

The first poem, attributed to the Song dynasty scholar Su Shi (1037-1101), reads:

The flowers have all been pruned and now grow magnificently. Tenderly awaiting an envoy who finally arrived and said nothing, which made the flowers hate him. Next year they likely won't bloom.

Su Shi's *Poem with Peony*. Hou Beiren painted a peony and made this inscription in the Old Apricot Villa at the age of 98, 18 March 2008, midnight.

Hou Beiren's second poem reads:

To where did spring slip away? Raising my glass, I ask the flowers. I spent all day asking, but they said nothing. For whom are they falling? For whom are they blooming?

This second poem is also attributed to Su Shi, though it is based on a Tang dynasty poem by Yan Yun.
