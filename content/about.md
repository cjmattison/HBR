*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour* is the third volume in UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. The publication was designed using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), the Getty's open-source publishing environment. The series is edited by UMAG's publisher Christopher Mattison.  

Primary text for this volume was excerpted from Dr Kevin McLoughlin's essay in the UMAG publication [*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour: Paintings by Hou Beiren*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1820.php). Additional research was carried out by UMAG Director Florian Knothe.

We gratefully acknowledge the generous support of The Hong Kong Museum Society and the Hou Beiren Museum in Kunshan, China. We also would like to thank Hou Beiren and his family for their generous time and assistance with the exhibition and publicationsâ€”in particular his wife Zhang Yunqin and daughter Rose Han.
