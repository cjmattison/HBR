*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour* is the third volume in UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. The publication was designed using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), the Getty's open-source publishing environment for creating both traditional and digitally enhanced books.

Primary text for this volume was excerpted from Dr Kevin McLoughlin's critical essay in the UMAG publication [*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour: Paintings by Hou Beiren*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1820.php), and research by UMAG Director Dr Florian Knothe. Additional material was provided by Mark Barnekow, Founder of the art consultancy [Contempor'ati](http://www.contemporati.com/), and by Edward Gui, Director of [NanHai Art](www.nanhaiart.com).

UMAG gratefully acknowledges the generous support of The Hong Kong Museum Society and the Hou Beiren Museum in Kunshan, China. We also would like to thank Hou Beiren and his family for their generous time and assistance with the exhibition and publications--in particular his wife Zhang Yunqin and daughter Rose Han.
