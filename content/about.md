*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour* is the second volume in UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. Edited by UMAG publisher Christopher Mattison, individual titles are designed by information architect Darcy Christ using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), the Getty's open-source publishing environment.  

Primary text for this volume was excerpted from Dr Kevin McLoughlin's essay in the UMAG publication [*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour: Paintings by Hou Beiren*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1820.php). Additional research was carried out by UMAG director Florian Knothe and curator Sarah Ng.

We gratefully acknowledge the generous support of The Hong Kong Museum Society and the Hou Beiren Museum in Kunshan, China. We also would like to thank Hou Beiren and his family for their generous time and assistance with the exhibition and publicationsâ€”in particular his wife Zhang Yunqin and daughter Rose Han.
