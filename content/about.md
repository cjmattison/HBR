*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour* is the third volume in UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. The publication was designed using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), the Getty's open-source publishing environment for creating traditional and digitally enhanced books.

Primary text for this volume was excerpted from Dr Kevin McLoughlin's critical introduction to the UMAG publication [*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour: Paintings by Hou Beiren*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1820.php). Additional material was provided by Mark Barnekow, Executive Director of [The University of Chicago Center in Hong Kong](www.uchicago.hk), and Founder of the art consultancy [Contempor'ati](http://www.contemporati.com/), and by Edward Gui, Director of [NanHai Art](www.nanhaiart.com).

UMAG gratefully acknowledges the generous support of The Hong Kong Museum Society, NanHai Gallery in Millbrae, California, and the Hou Beiren Museum in Kunshan, China. We would also like to thank Hou Beiren and his daughter Rose Han for their generous time and assistance with the exhibition and publications.
