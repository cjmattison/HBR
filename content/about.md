*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour* is a volume in UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. Titles are designed in Quire, the Getty's open-source publishing environment.  

Text for this publication was excerpted from Dr Kevin McLoughlin's essay in the UMAG book [*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour: Paintings by Hou Beiren*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1820.php).

We gratefully acknowledge the generous support of The Hong Kong Museum Society, HKU's Knowledge Exchange Office, and the Hou Beiren Museum in Kunshan, China. We also would like to thank Hou Beiren and his family for their generous time and assistance with the exhibition and publicationsâ€”in particular his wife Zhang Yunqin and daughter Rose Han.
