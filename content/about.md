*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour* is the third volume in UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. The publication was designed using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), the Getty's open-source publishing environment for creating traditional and digitally enhanced books.

Primary text for this digital volume was excerpted from Dr Kevin McLoughlin's critical introduction to the UMAG publication [*Clouds of Ink Pools of Colour: Paintings by Hou Beiren*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1820.php). Additional material was provided by Mark Barnekow, Executive Director of The University of Chicago Center in Hong Kong, and Founder of the art consultancy [Contempor'ati](http://www.contemporati.com/).

UMAG gratefully acknowledges the generous support of The Hong Kong Museum Society, Nanhai Gallery in Millbrae, California, and the Hou Beiren Museum in Kunshan, China. Please follow this [link](https://www.umag.hku.hk/en/) to explore more of UMAG's online content.
